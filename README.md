# Shiny Application Project

This project developed a shiny application for seraching and vizualizing text from several works of Edgar Allen Poe.
This may seem trival, but could prove to a powerful analysis tool depending on the type and sixe of the data sources. Large text data files can be transformed into visual patterns showing key areas of significance. This technique is utilized daily in many business segments and industries. 

The Edgar Allen Poe works utilized for this project are the following:

    The Fall of the House of Usher
    The Raven
    The Masque of the Red Death
    The Works of Edgar Allan Poe  - Volume 1

This simple exercise will display the words most commonly used in each of these works showing occurrance correlations.

The text files used in this shiny application were obtianed from [Project Gutenger](http://www.gutenberg.org). These are large text files and will take time to load, please be patient when you first launch the application or change the item you are analyzing. 

# Instructions 

On the left-hand side of the screen there is a drop-down menu asking you to select an item. 

If you select a new item, press the "Change" button below the drop-down menu to refresh the analysis. 

There are two scrollers - minimum word frequency and maximum number of words. These scrollers will let you ajust the analysis variables displaying counts for words that appear a minimum number of times or appear only a maximum number of times in the complete book or poem.
